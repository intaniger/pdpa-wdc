# Getting Deployed
> [!NOTE]
> You'll need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run this project. <br />
> It's also recommended that you have [BuildKit](https://docs.docker.com/build/buildkit/) installed on your machine in order to speed up a build process.


## 1. Clone this repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/intaniger/pdpa-wdc.git
```

## 2. Setup the `.env` file

```sh
echo PDPA_WDC_PG_PASSWORD=$(head -c 21 /dev/urandom | base64 | sed  's/\//+/g') > .env # random pg password
echo PUBLIC_PDPA_WDC_PGRST_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3000 >> .env
```
> [!NOTE] 
> If you're using a non-linux operating system, please replace `$(head -c 21 /dev/urandom | base64 | sed  's/\//+/g')` with your own randomized password instead.

Each environment variable will affect the behavior of the system, as listed below:

| Environment Variable Name | How it is used? |
| :---: | --- |
| PDPA_WDC_PG_PASSWORD | Root PostgreSQL password for setting up the `pg` service <br />  `pgrst` service also uses this variable in order to connect to `pg` before its startup. |
| PUBLIC_PDPA_WDC_PGRST_ENDPOINT | HTTP URL of the `pgrst` service that will be locally available for the webpage to connect to in order to retrieve and create a new Data Mapping record |

## 3. `docker compose up`

As the title says, let's get it running!

```sh
docker compose up
```
